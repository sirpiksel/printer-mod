Very easy, fairly useless, simple. Makes the spool easier to roll using some bearings.

## BOM
> [!TIP]
> precise measurements be dialed in using the **VarSet** in FreeCAD
- 1 threaded rod (diameter 8mm)
- 2 bearings (inner diameter 8mm; outer diameter 23mm)
- 1 washer (inner diameter 15mm; outer diameter 45mm)
- 2 hex nuts (side-to-side width of 10mm)

## Description
I bought my printer used, so the previous owner had already come up with this modification. Since their implementation was blocking the bearings from turning and did not have an endstop — preventing the spool from falling off at the end — like the stock solution, I decided to come up with my own version.

The relevance of this modification is — of course — questionable; the printer had no problems working without it, the point being that I could learn how to produce parts that have to comply with real-world constraints.

I salvaged most of the parts from the previous owners' solution, except for the roller that had seemed unsalvageable since the bearings were already sitting crooked in it.
